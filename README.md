# BJJ Scoreboard

## Overview
This is a websockets Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu scoreboard, we use it in our academy to teach to our BJJ practitioners how to count points in a tournament fight, there are some solutions online, but none fit our needs, so I built one.

With this software you can control the scoreboard from a mobile, tablet or any other device in the same wifi network. Hope it's useful to someone.
